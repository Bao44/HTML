                One particular book which is recommended
                reading is <u>The Street Lawyer</u> by 
                <u>John Grisham.</u> This book is about
                a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his
                priorities in life when a bad incident 
                occurs within his law firm. Consequently,
                he becomes acquainted with the inner city
                streets, and realizes the harsh existence
                of the homeless, and vows to give them a 
                chance in the courts. <u>The Streer Lawyer</u> 
                is a <b>great </b>book. It is <b>well written</b> 
                and <b>interesting </b>. Other books by <u>John 
                Grisham </u> include <u>The Firm, The 
                Pelican Brief.</u> and <u>The Client</u>.
